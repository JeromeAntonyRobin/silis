silis is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for RTL to GDSII flow based and built upon on several open-source softwares including **Icarus Verilog, yosys, OpenRoad, Netgen, klayout viewer** and other custom scripts that make the silicon design flow **easier for beginners and faster for experts** due to its **keyboard first, UX first approach**.

silis aims to perform all ASIC design steps from ASIC design to GDSII generation

silis is available under the **MIT License** and silis is meant to be used, forked, and be modified for user needs and **The source code which will not be made into the application will be available even after application releases, feel free to modify it to your needs and your work flow.**



# Still In Development

## [Click Here](https://github.com/JeromeAntonyRobin/silis/tree/main/experimental/promoted/by_JeromeAntonyRobin) to use the latest stable version

**Current status**: Early development, experimental features only 

**Latest stable**: Nothing stable yet, check `experimental/by_JeromeAntonyRobin` for latest work

## What works right now
- [x] Basic Icarus Verilog integration
- [x] Yosys synthesis pipeline
- [ ] OpenROAD integration (in progress)
- [ ] Full RTL-to-GDSII flow (planned)

## Project structure
- `prime/` - Production-ready code (when we have it)
- `experimental/` - Working features, still rough
- `dev_*/` - Personal dev playgrounds (ignore these)
- `reference/` - Documentation and examples
